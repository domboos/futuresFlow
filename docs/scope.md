# Project Setting
## Vola
Goal of  script is to adapt the model presented in Boos and Grob (2022) to forecast the volatility and outperform 
current state of the art volatility estimators in an out-of-sample performance comparison.

Out-of-sample performance comparison could be based on (DM-Test and MZ-Regression).

Scope:
- Equities: Standard indices without seasonality, e.g. S&P 500
- Commodities: Brent und die metals

## Models:
- GARCH(1,1)
- E-Garch
- bood-grob model


## Optimized Momentum

### Insample Results of pooled OLS
